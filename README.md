# 🏥 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning  

### 📅 Last Updated: 22 Jan, 2025  

## 📌 Overview  
**Pneumonia** is a severe lung infection caused by **viruses, fungi, or bacteria**, affecting one or both lungs. This project uses **Deep Learning** to automatically detect **pneumonia** in chest **X-ray images** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model.  

The dataset used is from **Kaggle**, consisting of **X-ray images categorized as "Normal" and "Pneumonia".** The model is built using **VGG16 with Transfer Learning**, leveraging **pre-trained weights** for efficient and accurate pneumonia detection.

## 🚀 Implementation: Pneumonia Detection using CNN  
This project uses a **pre-trained VGG16 model** with **Transfer Learning** to classify chest X-ray images into:  
- **Pneumonia (Diseased Lungs)**  
- **Normal (Healthy Lungs)**  

### 📌 Model Architecture  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing:**  
- Image resizing & normalization.  
- Splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets.  

2️⃣ **Deep Learning Model:**  
- **VGG16 (Pre-Trained CNN Model)** with **ImageNet weights**.  
- Custom **fully connected layers** for binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Normal).  

3️⃣ **Training & Evaluation:**  
- Model trained using **binary cross-entropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.  
- **Accuracy & Loss graphs** plotted for performance evaluation.
